How to setup an Auto Responder in cPanel
<p>An <strong>autoresponder</strong> replies automatically when a specific email address receives an email. This is helpful when you go on vacation, since you can easily let people who contact you know you are currently away and will respond to their request when you return. It's also great to use to notify customers you have received their email and they will get a response in a pre-determined time frame.</p>
