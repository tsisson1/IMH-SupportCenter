500 Internal Server when Loading WordPress 4.1.1

<p>The latest version of WordPress (version 4.1.1) requires that the PHP version be set to version 5.4 or higher. By default, new InMotion Hosting accounts are set to version PHP version 5.4.  However, in some cases, this version may have been changed.  For more information, please see <a href="http://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/php/how-to-change-the-php-version-your-account-uses">how to change the PHP version in cPanel</a>.  The 500 error can also occur when file permissions are incorrectly set for the WordPress installation files.  The following tutorial walks you through correcting the error when the PHP version is set to the wrong version.</p>
