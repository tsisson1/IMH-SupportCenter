Hiermee breng je de boodschap van DOK41 over en zo komt het \nmeer over als een presentje en geen reclame mok.\n\nVerder had ik ook nog:\n- Lekker bakje koffie van DOK41(logo)\n- Start de dag met een kopje koffie\n- Een goede start van de dag (DOK41 logo)\n- Voor een goede start van de dag\n- Innovatie in een kopje\n- Koffie de drijfveer voor (startende) ondernemers.\n\nIk heb ook al een opzet gemaakt, het is belangrijk dat het niet te druk \nwordt. In het voorbeeld heb ik de tekst op een vlak staan, maar het is \nook leuk zonder achtergrond.\n\nIk hoor wel wat jullie er van vinden..\n\n-- \nLysanne Ooteman\n+ 31 (0) 118 82 09
